## Overview
The **Python Scraper** is a web scraping tool designed to extract product details from Amazon search result pages and product pages. The scraper collects essential product information such as title, price, rating, and seller name, efficiently navigating through multiple search result pages and saving the extracted data in a structured format.

## Features
- Extracts product details like title, price, rating, and seller name.
- Scrapes multiple pages of Amazon search results.
- Implements HTTP request retries for reliability.
- Saves data incrementally and in a final CSV file.
- Prevents scraping blocks with request delays.

## Files in Repository
- **README.md** - Project documentation.
- **amazon_products.csv** - Output file containing extracted product data.
- **web_scraping.ipynb** - Jupyter Notebook used for running the scraper.

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas
```
